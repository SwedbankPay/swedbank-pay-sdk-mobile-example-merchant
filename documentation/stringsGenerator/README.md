# StringsGenerator

This is a simple commandline tool that takes /documentation/localization-strings.md and parses the table into three folders for each localization, and stores these under /strings.
This way we can have one place for all strings, and generate them to both platforms - or in multiple formats in the future (for all languages) in one go.  

## Usage 

swift run

## TODO

Android strings.xml
